### Learning Journal Entry for the Week


This week, I focused on setting up a local development environment to demonstrate a dynamic site with a database running on localhost. Additionally, I started Assignment 1, which involves designing, creating, and publishing websites for my startup idea using two different well-known CMSs: WordPress and Joomla. My startup idea is innovative and fits the criteria of a startup as defined by Neil Blumenthal and Wikipedia.

### Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I set up a local development environment using XAMPP, installed WordPress and Joomla, and explored various plugins/extensions to enhance the functionality of my websites. I also created and configured site content for both CMS platforms.

- Installed XAMPP to provide a local server environment.
- Configured Apache and MySQL services for running local websites.
- Installed WordPress and Joomla, each with its own database.
- Explored plugins/extensions such as WP Map, Bookly, and Forminator for WordPress; JEvents, AcyMailing, and BreezingForms for Joomla.
- Developed basic pages (Home, About Us, Services, Contact, Blog) and added a team page with bios.
- Created and embedded a short video introducing the startup and its mission.

### Estimated Hours

I spent around 12 hours this week on setting up the local development environment and starting on Assignment 1.

### Content Insights

Setting up a local development environment was crucial for testing and development purposes. Installing and configuring WordPress and Joomla provided insights into their different functionalities and interfaces. Exploring plugins and extensions helped me understand how to add and configure additional features to enhance my websites. I successfully installed and configured both WordPress and Joomla, created basic site content, and explored various plugins/extensions to enhance the functionality of my websites.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Working with two different CMS platforms (WordPress and Joomla) has given me a broader perspective on web development and the capabilities of each CMS. This experience is valuable for my future career, as it enhances my skills in setting up, customizing, and managing different CMS platforms. The practical experience of configuring databases, setting up plugins, and creating site content will be useful for any future web development projects. This week has been productive, with significant progress in setting up my local development environment and starting on Assignment 1. Moving forward, I will continue to refine the sites, ensuring all functionalities work seamlessly before deploying them to a public web server.
