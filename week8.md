# Practical 8

## 1. Making an Observation

My learning curve has been very steep this trimester undertaking the CP3402 subject. This is largely due to the subject’s focus on creating dynamic and responsive websites, which involves a diverse range of skills and technologies. We have covered topics such as CMS platforms (Joomla and WordPress), PHP programming, and the setup and management of local development environments. Each of these areas requires a distinct set of skills and a thorough understanding of how to integrate various technologies effectively.

The course’s practical approach demands that we not only learn these skills but also apply them in real-world scenarios. This includes working on dynamic content management systems, configuring and managing plugins, and ensuring that websites are both responsive and functional across different devices. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of the course, with multiple assignments and group projects, requires quick adaptation to new tools and techniques.

The complexity is further heightened by the need to collaborate effectively with team members, use project management tools like GitHub and Trello, and manage hosting environments. These factors contribute to a steep learning curve as we strive to master both the technical and collaborative aspects of web development.

## 2. Forming a Hypothesis

I believed that learning and applying a variety of technical skills in this subject would make me more employable. Specifically, I thought that by gaining experience in building dynamic and responsive websites, managing CMS platforms like WordPress and Joomla, and using project management tools like GitHub and Trello, I would be better prepared for real-world jobs in web development.

I expected that quickly picking up and using these skills would show potential employers that I can handle complex tasks and adapt to different challenges. My hypothesis was that this broad and hands-on learning approach would not only make me proficient in technical aspects but also improve my ability to work well with others and manage projects effectively.

## 3. Making a Prediction

With the range of skills and hands-on experience I've gained from this course, I believe I'll become much more employable. I expect that my ability to build and manage dynamic, responsive websites, handle various CMS platforms, and use project management tools effectively will make me a more appealing candidate for web development jobs.

I think employers will see my practical experience with plugins, hosting environments, and collaboration tools as a strong asset. My skills in managing projects and working well with others will also stand out. Overall, I’m confident that the knowledge and experience I’ve gained will improve my job prospects and help me stand out in the competitive job market.

## 4. Conducting an Experiment and Analyzing the Results

To test whether my new skills were truly making a difference, I decided to create and launch a dynamic, responsive website using WordPress. I began by setting up a new WordPress site and selecting a theme that fit the project’s needs. I then installed essential plugins for SEO, contact forms, and site performance. Moving on to design and customization, I tailored the theme to meet the project requirements, added various types of content, and ensured the site looked great and functioned well on different devices. This involved adjusting the theme’s CSS and utilizing page builders to achieve the desired design.

After setting up the site, I published it online and tested its functionality across various devices. I also sought feedback from peers to identify any areas for improvement. The feedback was largely positive, with peers appreciating the site’s design, ease of navigation, and responsiveness. They also noted effective use of plugins, although there were some minor issues, such as the need for image optimization to improve loading times. Overall, this experiment demonstrated that the skills I’ve developed are both practical and effective. Successfully building and launching a functional, responsive website, and receiving positive feedback, confirmed that the knowledge and experience gained from this course are valuable and enhance my ability to handle real-world web projects.
