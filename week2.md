## Learning Activities & Resources:

This week, I focused on learning how to build a website using the Joomla CMS. My journey began with setting up Joomla on my local machine, which involved downloading and configuring XAMPP, a popular local server environment. Here’s a detailed account of my learning process and the challenges I encountered:


- **Setting Up XAMPP:** 
  - I downloaded XAMPP from the official Apache Friends website and installed it on my laptop.
  - I learned to start and stop the Apache and MySQL services using the XAMPP Control Panel.

- **Resolving MySQL Server Conflicts:**
  - Initially, I faced an issue where the MySQL server would not start because port 3306 was already in use by MySQL Workbench, which was previously installed on my laptop.
  - I spent considerable time troubleshooting this issue. I learned how to change the port settings in the `my.ini` configuration file for MySQL, but it was complex and time-consuming.

- **Database Creation Using phpMyAdmin:**
  - After resolving the port conflict, I created a new database for Joomla using phpMyAdmin, a web interface for MySQL management.
  - I navigated to `localhost/phpmyadmin` and created a database named `joomla_db`.

- **Installing Joomla Locally:**
  - When I attempted to install Joomla on `localhost`, I encountered an error: "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)".
  - I spent a whole day trying to fix this issue, exploring various forums and documentation, but was ultimately unsuccessful in resolving the access denial problem.

- **Switching to Joomla Online:**
  - Due to the persistent issues with the local installation, I decided to use Joomla's online demo environment to continue my learning.
  - I accessed the Joomla demo at demo.joomla.org, which allowed me to explore Joomla without needing a local installation.

- **Creating a Basic Website:**
  - Using the online Joomla environment, I learned how to create a basic website. I experimented with creating articles, menus, and categories.
  - I set up a simple website called "CampusConnect" to apply what I had learned.

#### Estimated Hours:
I spent approximately 6 hours this week on this subject, not including time spent on the assignment. A significant portion of this time was dedicated to troubleshooting installation issues.

#### Content Insights:
Learning Joomla provided a different perspective on CMSs compared to WordPress. The installation and setup process gave me hands-on experience with server configurations and database management. Troubleshooting the MySQL server conflict and the "access denied" error gave me deeper insights into backend management, which is a critical part of web development. Additionally, working with Joomla's content management features, such as its article and menu systems, helped me understand how different CMS platforms organize and display content. Joomla’s modular approach to content management, using articles, categories, and modules, offered a flexible way to create and manage web content.       

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Through this week’s practical, I enhanced my troubleshooting skills and gained a deeper understanding of server environments and database configurations. These skills are crucial for web development and system administration roles. Additionally, using Joomla's online environment after facing local installation issues demonstrated the importance of adaptability and leveraging available resources to continue learning.

In conclusion, while the week was filled with challenges, it was an enriching experience that broadened my understanding of CMSs and improved my technical skills. Moving forward, I plan to continue exploring Joomla and compare its features and usability with WordPress to enhance my web development capabilities.
