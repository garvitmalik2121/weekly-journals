### week 7: Website Development and Advanced PHP Features

### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I engaged in two significant projects: developing the website for the JCUBSB Student Board using WordPress and advancing my PHP skills through a dedicated project.

For the JCUBSB Student Board website, I focused on creating the Events page. I began with a paper prototype and am now developing it on WordPress. I created four pages—Upcoming Events, Past Events, Registration, and Gallery—that will be linked as dropdown options on the Events page. I explored various plugins and resources such as Smart Slider 3, The Events Calendar, and NextGEN Gallery to enhance the functionality of the Events page. Integrating specific fonts also played a role in refining the page’s visual design. A challenge faced was maintaining a grid layout due to a limited number of images and event content, making data collection a significant part of the process.

In parallel, I worked on an advanced PHP project to deepen my understanding of PHP’s capabilities. This involved echoing HTML, using if/else statements, implementing loops (for, while, foreach), defining functions with parameters and default values, and including common headers and footers across multiple pages. The resources used included practical PHP exercises, the [WordPress Developer Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/), and tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/coLDoM1fQcc) and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-child-themes-3/level-up-to-wordpress-developer?autoplay=true&u=2223545).

### Estimated Hours
I dedicated approximately 4 hours to the advanced PHP project and about 15 hours to the JCUBSB Student Board website development this week.

### Content Insights
The advanced PHP project provided valuable insights into creating dynamic content and utilizing PHP’s advanced features effectively. Learning to use decision-making structures, loops, and functions with parameters enhanced my PHP programming skills. Integrating headers and footers improved the consistency of page design.

For the JCUBSB Student Board website, working with WordPress and various plugins helped in managing and displaying event-related content. Designing a grid layout for the Events page was challenging due to limited content and images, highlighting the importance of having sufficient data for effective design. The exploration of plugins and resources improved my understanding of WordPress’s capabilities.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week’s work has strengthened my skills in both PHP and WordPress. The PHP project enhanced my ability to develop dynamic web applications and handle advanced PHP features. The WordPress project improved my practical skills in website design and plugin integration, essential for web development roles. The challenges faced with the grid layout underscored the importance of data management and design consistency.
