## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I focused on creating a basic static page using SCSS and setting up an automated workflow with Gulp. I configured Gulp for tasks such as SCSS compilation, CSS minification, and HTML file copying. Using SCSS features like variables, nesting, and mixins, I styled the webpage, which included sections like "About Us," "Our Rooms," "Dining," and "Amenities." Key resources included the [Gulp Official Documentation](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) and [SCSS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation).

In parallel, significant progress was made on our group project for the James Cook University Student Association Board website. This week, I focused on designing and developing a custom theme using CSS to enhance the Events page, including pages for Upcoming Events, Past Events, Registration, and Gallery. I also began documenting the project to ensure clarity and maintainability. Our team has been collaborating effectively through Slack and GitHub, which has facilitated communication, code sharing, and version control.

## Estimated Hours

Approximately 10 hours.

## Content Insights

I successfully configured Gulp to automate the build process, which improved my workflow efficiency. By applying SCSS features, I created a more organized and flexible stylesheet. The Gulp tasks effectively compiled SCSS into CSS and applied styles as intended. For the group project, designing and developing a custom theme with CSS has enhanced the visual appeal and functionality of the Events page. Initial steps towards documenting the project have begun, which will be crucial for future reference and team collaboration. The use of Slack and GitHub has been instrumental in maintaining effective communication and managing the project's progress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This weekâ€™s activities provided hands-on experience with SCSS, Gulp, and custom theme development, which are valuable for web development and design roles. I improved my problem-solving skills, especially in handling `gulpfile.js` issues and deprecated npm packages. Designing a custom theme has deepened my understanding of CSS and theme customization. The importance of documentation and the benefits of using collaboration tools like Slack and GitHub were highlighted, demonstrating the value of structured communication and version control in successful project management.
