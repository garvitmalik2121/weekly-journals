I spent approximately 15 hours this week on this subject.

#### Content Insights
- **Initial Setup**: I downloaded and set up WordPress for the first time. Faced login issues initially and resolved them by watching tutorial videos.
- **Creating Pages**: Learned how to create and link pages using the block editor, though the initial design was not visually appealing.
- **Using Plugins**: Discovered and installed a plugin All-IN ONE-WP-MIGRATION, which significantly improved the site's design.
- **Hosting Challenges**: Spent considerable time (4 hours) researching hosting options and ultimately used cPanel hosting. Utilized a plugin All-IN ONE-WP-MIGRATION to transfer and set up the site on the new domain.
- **Group Formation Reflection**: As a bachelor student grouped with masterâ€™s students, I was keen to learn from my seniors. We reviewed classmates to form a group for the assignment and decided to use WhatsApp as our communication tool. This helped us coordinate effectively and ensured that everyone was on the same page. I am enthusiastic about developing the assignment with them, as this collaboration offers a valuable learning experience and the opportunity to gain insights from their advanced knowledge and expertise.
