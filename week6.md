## Week 6

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, we initiated our group project, focusing on understanding the client requirements and setting up the development environment for a WordPress site. Key activities included:
- Setting up a WordPress site locally using Local by Flywheel.
- Studying the process of creating starter themes.
- Configuring Git for version control and project management.
- Participating in group discussions and dividing tasks among team members.
- Conducting paper prototyping to outline web pages and brainstorm features.

**Resources:**
- [Local by Flywheel Documentation](https://localwp.com/help-docs/)
- [WordPress Starter Themes Guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-starter-themes/)
- [GitHub Docs: Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 12 hours this week on these learning activities.

## Content Insights
This week, I learned about the structure and components of WordPress themes through the process of creating a starter theme. This understanding is crucial for our custom development work. The paper prototyping session provided clarity on the layout and structure of our web pages, helping us visualize the site before actual development. This hands-on approach with pen and paper was an effective way to communicate ideas and iterate quickly.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The group discussions and task division emphasized the importance of clear communication and teamwork in project management. Using Git for version control ensured that our workflow remained organized and collaborative. Paper prototyping demonstrated the value of initial design planning, allowing us to address potential issues early and create a more cohesive design strategy.

**First Task and Weightage:**
Our first task involved outlining the web pages and brainstorming features, which was essential for setting the foundation of our project. We assigned a 5% weightage to this task to reflect its contribution to the overall project. The paper prototypes we created served as a visual guide for our subsequent development efforts.

**Next Steps:**
- Review the prototypes in a group meeting and finalize the layout.
- Plan the development process and discuss the effective use of tools.
- Schedule regular standup meetings to track progress and address challenges.
